### Microsoft Corporation

|      | November 1998 ‚Äì June 2000 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Release Program Manager | Redmond, Washington |

As a key member of Microsoft‚Äôs Product Release team, responsibilities included application development, system design and project management for release of Microsoft product to the marketplace.  Projects driven and developed by myself included:

* **Release To Web System (RTW)** - This suite of applications was the primary release mechanism for product delivery to Microsoft.com worldwide.  The system boasted an average of 1000 releases per month and tracked workflow, sign-off, QA, and virus scan. All released bits were vaulted to a centralized repository within the Software Release Labs.  The application was designed entirely from the ground up to fulfill Microsoft‚Äôs need to release product in less than 3 hours.

* **PIRS University** - Product Information Release Services (PIRS) University was an online training center that provided company-wide services and computer-based training related to product release.  This site provided some of the following capabilities: automated content publication for non-technical business process owners, hierarchical management of heterogeneous data and online training registration for course offerings.  This site provided centralized management for what was previously a fragmented information base.

* **Media Shipment Tracking System (ShipInfo)** - The ShipInfo system gathered and tracked all software media shipments made to Microsoft‚Äôs third-party manufacturers.  This allowed manufacturing facilities to plan production cycles as well as track the progress of any shipment.  The system consisted of multiple SQL Server databases in each of Microsoft‚Äôs regions of operation.  These databases received shipment information through a web-based front end from each of the release labs. The data was then warehoused three times daily to coincide with the close of business at Microsoft‚Äôs American, European and Asian operating centers.  The warehoused data was then made available through the corporate extranet to vendors and manufacturers.

Each system was developed according to multi-tier design architecture standards and were built using **HTML, ASP, Visual Basic, JavaScript, VBScript, CSS, and SQL stored procedures**. Where possible, **MTS COM objects** were created for re-usability and programming practices followed a component-based object model.  Additional responsibilities as Release Program Manager ranged from systems analysis to solution implementation and included such things as **application prototyping, database implementation, user-interface design** and **technical, functional & user documentation**.

## My Story

A brief timeline of my development career written as a narrative.

<dl>
  <dt>1994-1997 ‚Ä¢ DeVry University ‚Ä¢ Pomona, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Bright-eyed and Bushy Tailed -</i></dd>
    <dd>Schooled at DeVry University in technology, programming, and information systems. Graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (BSc CIS) degree.</dd>
  <dt>1997-1998 ‚Ä¢ Kirtland AFB ‚Ä¢ Albuquerque, NM</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Proving Myself -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, NM - Underwent FBI background check and was granted secret clearance to work on web-based collaboration applications dealing with guidance systems and other technologies relevant to our armed forces.</dd>
  <dt>1998 - 2000 ‚Ä¢ ‚ú® Microsoft ‚ú® ‚Ä¢ Redmond, WA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- The Promised Land -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Microsoft as a Release Program Manager writing web-based applications to manage the cataloging, scanning, workflow, and distribution of all Microsoft's downloadable content to microsoft.com's Download Center. This was a wonderful example of the kind of dynamic, creative, and engaging company culture I thrived in and am looking to join once again.</dd>
  <dt>2000 - 2002 ‚Ä¢ Velodea ‚Ä¢ Milan, Italy</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Going International -</i></dd>
    <dd>Left Microsoft to join The Velodea Group - Became employee number seven of this dotcom startup. It was here I experienced a new level of intensity and self-determination. I traveled frequently between Los Angeles and Milan offices and served as the head of technology and lead developer for many corporate projects, both internal and external.</dd>
  <dt>2002 - 2006 ‚Ä¢ devAware Technology Solutions ‚Ä¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Opportunities at Home -</i></dd>
    <dd>Wanting to settle down locally, I transitioned to the role of independent contractor and freelance developer under my own company umbrella. This was liberating, stressful, and intensely time consuming. It helped me realize I love coding, development, and technology but am less excited with administration, payroll, and collections. I did learn to wear many hats while working with such companies as Sony, Fox Studios and Xtreme Desktops.</dd>
  <dt>2006 - 2014 ‚Ä¢ Velodea (v3) ‚Ä¢ Pasadena, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- New Opportunities with Old Friends -</i></dd>
    <dd>In 2006 I was asked to return to Velodea which was under new management after having suffered a series of financial setbacks. I agreed to help turn the business around by implementing a new set of procedures designed to streamline operations. It relied on a smaller dev team, tighter turn-arounds, and more effective project management.</dd>
    <dd>With this new approach we managed to lift the company out a $200k deficit and turn a profit in under a year.</dd>
    <dd>The success of these efforts assured another eight years of fulfilling and prosperous work before having to make the difficult decision to close Velodea's doors due to the unfortunate and untimely passing of our CEO and Managing Director, Michael Leong.</dd>
    <dd>We successfully transitioned open projects to our partners and bid farewell to the company.</dd>
  <dt>2014 - 2016 ‚Ä¢ <i>Three-year Hiatus</i> ‚Ä¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Being of Service -</i></dd>
    <dd>Needing a recharge, I took time off to re-evaluate what I wanted my focus and position to be in the industry. At this point I was called upon to care for a loved one who had fallen ill with a terminal form of cancer. I stepped into the role of caregiver and for the next two years provided in-home care until her passing.</dd>
    <dd><i>That experience allowed me to witness what it means to have strength and dignity in the face of the inevitable.</i></dd>
  <dt>2017 - 2018 ‚Ä¢ <i>Education, Certification & Training, Oh My!</i> ‚Ä¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Back to School -</i></dd>
    <dd>Having been absent from the development landscape for two years I found technology had progressed at a breakneck pace. To close the gap I devoted the next
    year and a half to self-paced study and online learning. Leveling up was my new full-time job.</dd>
    <dd>During this time I re-engaged with the development community and have been coding, learning, and absorbing with a passion. I set out to master todays' most in-demand Front End technologies and have earned a Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree in the process. I now have my sights on taking Google's Mobile Web Specialist certification exam next.</dd>
